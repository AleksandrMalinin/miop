{"pageProps":{"album":{"title":"mold","type":"EP","year":2023,"duration":"10:59","description":"I recorded this mini-album in Lisbon, adapting to new, unpredictable life circumstances, full of anxiety, uncertainty, caught off guard by my own transformation into some unknown version of myself that I had never seen before. And, literally infected by a new destructive form of freedom that I barely wished to experience, I nevertheless began to see even more beauty, touching and inexpressible things in everything around me. And this led me to the idea, unexpectedly becoming the inspiration for this little album, which was formulated by my friend - it is an internal, indistinct 'dance with lowered hands.'","credits":{"designer":"<a href='https://www.instagram.com/quollibet/'>Daria Horoshih</a>","mastering":"<a href='https://www.instagram.com/aurummusic/'>Pavel Afanasyev</a>"}}},"__N_SSG":true}

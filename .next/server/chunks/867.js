And, literally infected by a new destructive form of freedom that I barely wished to experience, I nevertheless began to see even more beauty, touching and inexpressible things in everything around me. And this led me to the idea, unexpectedly becoming the inspiration for this little album, which was formulated by my friend - it is an internal, indistinct \'dance with lowered hands.\'","credits":{"designer":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/quollibet/\'>Daria Horoshih</a>","mastering":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/aurummusic/\'>Pavel Afanasyev</a>"}},"lemma":{"title":"lemma","year":2022,"duration":"18:48","description":"The album consists of an attempt to overcome destructive fixations and find a secluded and safe point in which it would be possible to discern and comprehend what is happening. Thus even what feels creative at some point turns out to be destructive â€” growing and growing, it absorbs everything that surrounds you until finally collapses into an indecipherable pulsating point.","credits":{"designer":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/avleriev/\'>avleriev</a>","mastering":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/aurummusic/\'>Pavel Afanasyev</a>"}},"semblance":{"title":"semblance","year":2022,"duration":"18:00","description":"The idea behind this debut EP was an attempt to create dramatic tension in an ascetic and predictable acoustic landscape specific to the minimal. for myself I define this material as a personal experiment, albeit with possible displacements, with the language of a particular genre of electronic music.","credits":{"designer":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/pavelripley/\'>Pavel Ripley</a>","mastering":"<a href=\'https://www.instagram.com/aurummusic/\'>Pavel Afanasyev</a>"}}}');
